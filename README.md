This is my diploma college "Government Polytechnic Bhojpur, Bihar" mini project.
The purpose of this project is to unite the students of Computer Science.

The project contains Quiz, Hackathon, and Workshop in the Events section.
There are also many other sections like Resources, which provide the best notes and lectures to help students pass their semester.

It will also take complaints from students, and if the complaint is valid, then the IT Club will submit the post or email to the SBTE, Education Minister of Bihar, Minister of Science and Technology of Bihar and the CoE of IIT Patna to solve the college problem. But first, we will try to solve the problem within the college.

Technology used to build this website: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

If you notice any errors in my project, I would like to say that this is my first project, so please donâ€™t mind.
